## Game Walkthrough
Example of the game made:<br>

<img src="assets/demos/walkthrough.gif" width="75%">

## Brief
Tic-tac-toe is a game for two players, :x: and :o:, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner.

_ _ _
In **<u>this game</u>**, you will be playing as :x: & computer will be playing as :o:

### <b>Playing</b>
- :x: plays first.
- Click on any grid box to play your move.
- Click reset button after completion to reset the board and play again.

**Note:** <br>
 Currently, there is no (real) computer playing against you.<br>
 It is just a JS code that plays randomly, regardless of your move.<br>

 ## Web App
 While you can go to the [website](https://tictactoeegame.netlify.app) to play, I would suggest you to use the **<u>web app</u>** so that you don't have to go to the browser and type in the website everytime to want to play. You can directly open the **web application** on your **home screen** or the **desktop shortcut** on your computer to play.<br>

 **Follow the steps:**
 - For desktop users
    - Chrome
        - Open the [website](https://tictactoeegame.netlify.app)
        - Tap the **three dots &#8942;** on the top right corner
        - Click on **More tools**
        - Click on **Create shortcut**
        - Check Open as window option and click create
- For mobile users
    - Chrome
        - Navigate to the [website](https://tictactoeegame.netlify.app)
        - Tap the **three dots &#8942;** on the top right corner
        - Scroll down and click on **Add to home screen**
        - Click **Add**
    - Safari
        - Navigate to the [website](https://tictactoeegame.netlify.app)
        - Click on **Share icon** at bottom<br> 
        (On the iPad, share icon is located at the top)
        - Tap **Add to home screen** from the menu
        - Type name for shortcut and then tap **Add** button<br>

Now you can use this game as a **Web App**.<br>
The processes will be same with other browsers too.

## External Libraries used
[PWACompat](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/pwacompat) - PWACompat is a library that brings the Web App Manifest to non-compliant browsers for better Progressive Web Apps. This mostly means creating splash screens and icons for Mobile Safari, as well as supporting IE/Edge's Pinned Sites feature.
