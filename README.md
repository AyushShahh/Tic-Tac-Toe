## Game Walkthrough
Example of the game made:<br>

<img src="assets/demos/walkthrough-scores.gif" width="75%">

## Brief
Tic-tac-toe is a game for two players, :x: and :o:, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner.
___

### <b>Playing</b>:
- **X** plays first
- Click on any grid box to play your move
- Click reset button after completion to reset the board and play again

 ## Web App
 While you can go to the [website](https://tictactoeegame.netlify.app) to play, I would suggest you to use the **web app** so that you don't have to go to the browser and type in the website everytime to want to play. You can directly open the **web application** on your **home screen** or the **desktop shortcut** on your computer to play.<br>

 **Follow the steps:**
1. For desktop users
- Chrome
    - Open the [website](https://tictactoeegame.netlify.app)
    - Tap the **three dots &#8942;** on the top right corner
    - Click on **More tools**
    - Click on **Create shortcut**
    - Check **Open as window** option and click create
2. For mobile users
- Chrome
    - Navigate to the [website](https://tictactoeegame.netlify.app)
    - Tap the **three dots &#8942;** on the top right corner
    - Scroll down and click on **Add to home screen**
    - Click **Add**
- Safari
    - Navigate to the [website](https://tictactoeegame.netlify.app)
    - Click on **Share icon** at bottom<br> 
    (On the iPad, share icon is located at the **top-right**)
    - Tap **Add to home screen** from the menu
    - Type name for shortcut and then tap **Add** button

Now you can use this game as a **Web App**.<br>
The process might be similar for other browsers too.

 ## To-Do List
 This contains the list of features I'm working on or wish to implement them in future.
 - [x] Adding two player mode
 - [ ] Giving user the option to either play as :x: or :o:
 - [x] Showing scores
 - [ ] :x: and :o: animate while making a move
 - [ ] Linethrough on the respective column, row or diagonal when a player wins
 - [x] Adding AI using JavaScript minimax algorithm
 - [ ] Adding different levels that user can select to play against computer. e.g. Easy, hard, unbeatable
 - [ ] Adding multiplayer mode
