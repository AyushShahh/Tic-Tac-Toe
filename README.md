## Brief
Tic-tac-toe is a game for two players, :x: and :o:, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner.

_ _ _
In **<u>this game</u>**, you will be playing as :x: & computer will be playing as :o:

### Playing
- :x: plays first.
- Click on any grid box to play your move.
- Click reset button after completion to reset the board and play again.

**Note:** <br>
 Currently, there is no (real) computer playing against you.<br>
 It is just a JS code that plays randomly, regardless of your move.<br>

 ## To-Do List
 This contains the list of features I'm working on or wish to impliment them in future
 - [] Adding **AI** using JavaScript **minimax algorithm**
    - [] Addeing **different levels** that user can select.<br>
    e.g. Easy, hard, unbeatable
